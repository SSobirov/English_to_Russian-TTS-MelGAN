northandsouth_01_f000001 ON ITS APPEARANCE IN HOUSEHOLD WORDS, THIS TALE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFORM TO THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF A WEEKLY PUBLICATION,
northandsouth_01_f000002 AND LIKEWISE TO CONFINE ITSELF WITHIN CERTAIN ADVERTISED LIMITS, IN ORDER THAT FAITH MIGHT BE KEPT WITH THE PUBLIC.
northandsouth_01_f000003 ALTHOUGH THESE CONDITIONS WERE MADE AS LIGHT AS THEY WELL COULD BE, THE AUTHOR FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOPE THE STORY IN THE MANNER ORIGINALLY INTENDED,
northandsouth_01_f000004 AND, MORE ESPECIALLY, WAS COMPELLED TO HURRY ON EVENTS WITH AN IMPROBABLE RAPIDITY TOWARDS THE CLOSE.
northandsouth_01_f000005 IN SOME DEGREE TO REMEDY THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT, VARIOUS SHORT PASSAGES HAVE BEEN INSERTED, AND SEVERAL NEW CHAPTERS ADDED.
northandsouth_01_f000006 WITH THIS BRIEF EXPLANATION, THE TALE IS COMMENDED TO THE KINDNESS OF THE READER,
northandsouth_01_f000007 BESEKING HYM LOWLY, OF MERCY AND PITE,
northandsouth_01_f000008 OF ITS RUDE MAKYNG TO HAVE COMPASSION.
northandsouth_01_f000009 CHAPTER I HASTE TO THE WEDDING
northandsouth_01_f000010 WOOED AND MARRIED AND A.
northandsouth_01_f000011 EDITH! SAID MARGARET, GENTLY, EDITH!
northandsouth_01_f000012 BUT, AS MARGARET HALF SUSPECTED, EDITH HAD FALLEN ASLEEP.
northandsouth_01_f000013 SHE LAY CURLED UP ON THE SOFA IN THE BACK DRAWING ROOM IN HARLEY STREET, LOOKING VERY LOVELY IN HER WHITE MUSLIN AND BLUE RIBBONS.
northandsouth_01_f000014 IF TITANIA HAD EVER BEEN DRESSED IN WHITE MUSLIN AND BLUE RIBBONS, AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ON A CRIMSON DAMASK SOFA IN A BACK DRAWING ROOM, EDITH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR HER.
northandsouth_01_f000015 MARGARET WAS STRUCK AFRESH BY HER COUSINS BEAUTY. THEY HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD, AND ALL ALONG EDITH HAD BEEN REMARKED UPON BY EVERY ONE,
northandsouth_01_f000016 EXCEPT MARGARET, FOR HER PRETTINESS,
northandsouth_01_f000017 BUT MARGARET HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL THE LAST FEW DAYS, WHEN THE PROSPECT OF SOON LOSING HER COMPANION SEEMED TO GIVE FORCE TO EVERY SWEET QUALITY AND CHARM WHICH EDITH POSSESSED.
northandsouth_01_f000018 THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT WEDDING DRESSES, AND WEDDING CEREMONIES,
northandsouth_01_f000019 AND CAPTAIN LENNOX, AND WHAT HE HAD TOLD EDITH ABOUT HER FUTURE LIFE AT CORFU, WHERE HIS REGIMENT WAS STATIONED,
northandsouth_01_f000020 AND THE DIFFICULTY OF KEEPING A PIANO IN GOOD TUNE A DIFFICULTY WHICH EDITH SEEMED TO CONSIDER AS ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE THAT COULD BEFALL HER IN HER MARRIED LIFE,
northandsouth_01_f000021 AND WHAT GOWNS SHE SHOULD WANT IN THE VISITS TO SCOTLAND, WHICH WOULD IMMEDIATELY SUCCEED HER MARRIAGE,
northandsouth_01_f000022 BUT THE WHISPERED TONE HAD LATTERLY BECOME MORE DROWSY,
northandsouth_01_f000023 AND MARGARET, AFTER A PAUSE OF A FEW MINUTES, FOUND, AS SHE FANCIED, THAT IN SPITE OF THE BUZZ IN THE NEXT ROOM,
northandsouth_01_f000024 EDITH HAD ROLLED HERSELF UP INTO A SOFT BALL OF MUSLIN AND RIBBON, AND SILKEN CURLS, AND GONE OFF INTO A PEACEFUL LITTLE AFTER DINNER NAP.
northandsouth_01_f000025 MARGARET HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TELLING HER COUSIN OF SOME OF THE PLANS AND VISIONS WHICH SHE ENTERTAINED AS TO HER FUTURE LIFE IN THE COUNTRY PARSONAGE,
northandsouth_01_f000026 WHERE HER FATHER AND MOTHER LIVED,
northandsouth_01_f000027 AND WHERE HER BRIGHT HOLIDAYS HAD ALWAYS BEEN PASSED, THOUGH FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HER AUNT SHAWS HOUSE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED AS HER HOME.
northandsouth_01_f000028 BUT IN DEFAULT OF A LISTENER, SHE HAD TO BROOD OVER THE CHANGE IN HER LIFE SILENTLY AS HERETOFORE.
northandsouth_01_f000029 IT WAS A HAPPY BROODING, ALTHOUGH TINGED WITH REGRET AT BEING SEPARATED FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME FROM HER GENTLE AUNT AND DEAR COUSIN.
northandsouth_01_f000030 AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE DELIGHT OF FILLING THE IMPORTANT POST OF ONLY DAUGHTER IN HELSTONE PARSONAGE, PIECES OF THE CONVERSATION OUT OF THE NEXT ROOM CAME UPON HER EARS.
northandsouth_01_f000031 HER AUNT SHAW WAS TALKING TO THE FIVE OR SIX LADIES WHO HAD BEEN DINING THERE, AND WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE STILL IN THE DINING ROOM.
northandsouth_01_f000032 THEY WERE THE FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCES OF THE HOUSE, NEIGHBOURS WHOM MISSIS SHAW CALLED FRIENDS, BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO DINE WITH THEM MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WITH ANY OTHER PEOPLE,
northandsouth_01_f000033 AND BECAUSE IF SHE OR EDITH WANTED ANYTHING FROM THEM, OR THEY FROM HER, THEY DID NOT SCRUPLE TO MAKE A CALL AT EACH OTHERS HOUSES BEFORE LUNCHEON.
northandsouth_01_f000034 THESE LADIES AND THEIR HUSBANDS WERE INVITED, IN THEIR CAPACITY OF FRIENDS, TO EAT A FAREWELL DINNER IN HONOUR OF EDITHS APPROACHING MARRIAGE.
northandsouth_01_f000035 EDITH HAD RATHER OBJECTED TO THIS ARRANGEMENT, FOR CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE BY A LATE TRAIN THIS VERY EVENING,
northandsouth_01_f000036 BUT, ALTHOUGH SHE WAS A SPOILED CHILD, SHE WAS TOO CARELESS AND IDLE TO HAVE A VERY STRONG WILL OF HER OWN,
northandsouth_01_f000037 AND GAVE WAY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER MOTHER HAD ABSOLUTELY ORDERED THOSE EXTRA DELICACIES OF THE SEASON WHICH ARE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE EFFICACIOUS AGAINST IMMODERATE GRIEF AT FAREWELL DINNERS.
northandsouth_01_f000038 SHE CONTENTED HERSELF BY LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR, MERELY PLAYING WITH THE FOOD ON HER PLATE, AND LOOKING GRAVE AND ABSENT,
northandsouth_01_f000039 WHILE ALL AROUND HER WERE ENJOYING THE MOTS OF MISTER GREY, THE GENTLEMAN WHO ALWAYS TOOK THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE AT MISSIS SHAWS DINNER PARTIES,
northandsouth_01_f000040 AND ASKED EDITH TO GIVE THEM SOME MUSIC IN THE DRAWING ROOM.
northandsouth_01_f000041 MISTER GREY WAS PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE OVER THIS FAREWELL DINNER, AND THE GENTLEMEN STAID DOWN STAIRS LONGER THAN USUAL.
northandsouth_01_f000042 IT WAS VERY WELL THEY DID TO JUDGE FROM THE FRAGMENTS OF CONVERSATION WHICH MARGARET OVERHEARD.
northandsouth_01_f000043 I SUFFERED TOO MUCH MYSELF, NOT THAT I WAS NOT EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE POOR DEAR GENERAL, BUT STILL DISPARITY OF AGE IS A DRAWBACK,
northandsouth_01_f000044 ONE THAT I WAS RESOLVED EDITH SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER.
northandsouth_01_f000045 OF COURSE, WITHOUT ANY MATERNAL PARTIALITY, I FORESAW THAT THE DEAR CHILD WAS LIKELY TO MARRY EARLY,
northandsouth_01_f000046 INDEED, I HAD OFTEN SAID THAT I WAS SURE SHE WOULD BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE WAS NINETEEN.
northandsouth_01_f000047 I HAD QUITE A PROPHETIC FEELING WHEN CAPTAIN LENNOX AND HERE THE VOICE DROPPED INTO A WHISPER, BUT MARGARET COULD EASILY SUPPLY THE BLANK.
northandsouth_01_f000048 THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE IN EDITHS CASE HAD RUN REMARKABLY SMOOTH.
northandsouth_01_f000049 MISSIS SHAW HAD GIVEN WAY TO THE PRESENTIMENT, AS SHE EXPRESSED IT,
northandsouth_01_f000050 AND HAD RATHER URGED ON THE MARRIAGE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH MANY OF EDITHS ACQUAINTANCES HAD FORMED FOR HER, A YOUNG AND PRETTY HEIRESS.
northandsouth_01_f000051 BUT MISSIS SHAW SAID THAT HER ONLY CHILD SHOULD MARRY FOR LOVE, AND SIGHED EMPHATICALLY, AS IF LOVE HAD NOT BEEN HER MOTIVE FOR MARRYING THE GENERAL.
northandsouth_01_f000052 MISSIS SHAW ENJOYED THE ROMANCE OF THE PRESENT ENGAGEMENT RATHER MORE THAN HER DAUGHTER.
northandsouth_01_f000053 NOT BUT THAT EDITH WAS VERY THOROUGHLY AND PROPERLY IN LOVE,
northandsouth_01_f000054 STILL SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PREFERRED A GOOD HOUSE IN BELGRAVIA, TO ALL THE PICTURESQUENESS OF THE LIFE WHICH CAPTAIN LENNOX DESCRIBED AT CORFU.
northandsouth_01_f000055 THE VERY PARTS WHICH MADE MARGARET GLOW AS SHE LISTENED, EDITH PRETENDED TO SHIVER AND SHUDDER AT,
northandsouth_01_f000056 PARTLY FOR THE PLEASURE SHE HAD IN BEING COAXED OUT OF HER DISLIKE BY HER FOND LOVER, AND PARTLY BECAUSE ANYTHING OF A GIPSY OR MAKE SHIFT LIFE WAS REALLY DISTASTEFUL TO HER.
northandsouth_01_f000057 YET HAD ANY ONE COME WITH A FINE HOUSE, AND A FINE ESTATE, AND A FINE TITLE TO BOOT, EDITH WOULD STILL HAVE CLUNG TO CAPTAIN LENNOX WHILE THE TEMPTATION LASTED,
northandsouth_01_f000058 WHEN IT WAS OVER, IT IS POSSIBLE SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD LITTLE QUALMS OF ILL CONCEALED REGRET THAT CAPTAIN LENNOX COULD NOT HAVE UNITED IN HIS PERSON EVERYTHING THAT WAS DESIRABLE.
northandsouth_01_f000059 IN THIS SHE WAS BUT HER MOTHERS CHILD, WHO, AFTER DELIBERATELY MARRYING GENERAL SHAW WITH NO WARMER FEELING THAN RESPECT FOR HIS CHARACTER AND ESTABLISHMENT,
northandsouth_01_f000060 WAS CONSTANTLY, THOUGH QUIETLY, BEMOANING HER HARD LOT IN BEING UNITED TO ONE WHOM SHE COULD NOT LOVE.
northandsouth_01_f000061 I HAVE SPARED NO EXPENSE IN HER TROUSSEAU, WERE THE NEXT WORDS MARGARET HEARD.
northandsouth_01_f000062 SHE HAS ALL THE BEAUTIFUL INDIAN SHAWLS AND SCARFS THE GENERAL GAVE TO ME, BUT WHICH I SHALL NEVER WEAR AGAIN.
northandsouth_01_f000063 SHE IS A LUCKY GIRL, REPLIED ANOTHER VOICE, WHICH MARGARET KNEW TO BE THAT OF MISSIS GIBSON, A LADY WHO WAS TAKING A DOUBLE INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION,
northandsouth_01_f000064 FROM THE FACT OF ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS HAVING BEEN MARRIED WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.
northandsouth_01_f000065 HELEN HAD SET HER HEART UPON AN INDIAN SHAWL, BUT REALLY WHEN I FOUND WHAT AN EXTRAVAGANT PRICE WAS ASKED, I WAS OBLIGED TO REFUSE HER.
northandsouth_01_f000066 SHE WILL BE QUITE ENVIOUS WHEN SHE HEARS OF EDITH HAVING INDIAN SHAWLS. WHAT KIND ARE THEY? DELHI? WITH THE LOVELY LITTLE BORDERS?
northandsouth_01_f000067 MARGARET HEARD HER AUNTS VOICE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD RAISED HERSELF UP FROM HER HALF RECUMBENT POSITION,
northandsouth_01_f000068 AND WERE LOOKING INTO THE MORE DIMLY LIGHTED BACK DRAWING ROOM.
northandsouth_01_f000069 EDITH! EDITH! CRIED SHE, AND THEN SHE SANK AS IF WEARIED BY THE EXERTION. MARGARET STEPPED FORWARD.
northandsouth_01_f000070 EDITH IS ASLEEP, AUNT SHAW. IS IT ANYTHING I CAN DO?
